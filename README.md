# gl33
Bindings to OpenGL 3.3

## Stability

The `gl33` crate presents OpenGL 3.3 bindings for Rust, as described by [gl.xml](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/blob/master/xml/gl.xml).

It's *very unlikely* that an update to GL 3.3 would ever be released that would cause a breaking change.
